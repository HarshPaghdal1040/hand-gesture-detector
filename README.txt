🖐️ Hand Gesture Recognition with Voice Feedback
This Python project detects hand gestures using OpenCV and provides real-time voice feedback using pyttsx3. It dynamically adjusts to hand position and size using contour analysis, making gesture detection more accurate and stable.

🚀 Features:
Real-time video capture using webcam
Dynamic ROI based on detected hand location
Finger counting using convexity defects
Voice output of gestures using pyttsx3
Gesture smoothing using detection history buffer

🧰 Tech Stack:
Python
OpenCV
NumPy
pyttsx3 (offline text-to-speech)

🎮 Gestures Recognized:
One (1 finger)
Two (2 fingers)
Three (3 fingers)
Four (4 fingers)
Five (5 fingers)

▶️ How to Run:

pip install opencv-python numpy pyttsx3
python hand_gesture_voice.py
